        <h2>Understanding the Fundamental concept behind the Evolution of 5G Technology</h2>
        The evolution of 5G technology is driven by the demand for faster data speeds, ultra-low latency, and the ability to connect massive 
        numbers of devices. Starting from 1G's analog voice communication, each generation improved upon speed and connectivity, with 2G 
        introducing digital voice and SMS, 3G enabling mobile internet, and 4G delivering mobile broadband for HD streaming and apps. 5G offers 
        speeds up to 10 Gbps, latency as low as 1 millisecond, and can support 1 million devices per square kilometer, enabling the Internet of 
        Things (IoT) revolution. It utilizes millimeter waves for faster data, supported by small cells and massive MIMO technology for better 
        coverage. Additionally, 5G introduces network slicing, allowing customizable networks for specific needs, and integrates edge computing to 
        process data locally, reducing delays. 5G's impact spans autonomous vehicles, smart cities, remote surgeries, and immersive AR/VR 
        experiences, laying the foundation for the future of communication and smart infrastructure.

        <h2>What are the limitations in evolution of 5G technology</h2>
        The evolution of 5G technology faces several limitations, including high infrastructure costs due to the need for extensive small cells 
        and fiber optic cables. Millimeter waves provide faster speeds but have limited coverage and are easily obstructed, affecting rural and 
        suburban areas. Device compatibility is another hurdle, as users need 5G-compatible devices, which can slow adoption. Power consumption is 
        increased, leading to shorter battery life for devices and higher operational costs. Cybersecurity concerns arise with the massive number 
        of connected devices, and regulatory challenges related to spectrum allocation can delay deployment. Additionally, there are ongoing 
        health and environmental concerns about the potential impacts of higher frequency radiation.
